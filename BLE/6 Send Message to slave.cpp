/*
 *  ------------------ [BLE_10] - Characteristic notification - Master -------
 *  Explanation: This example shows how notifying processes works.
 *  The program first look for a certain BLE device and connects to it.
 *  Then, it subscribes to notifications of a certain characteristic and wait
 *  for notifications from the slave. Once 5 notifications are received 
 *  (or timeout is reached) the Master terminates the connection and starts again.
 *  This example is though to be used together with example BLE_11.
 * 
 *  NOTE: the master can be replaced by a smartphone with a BLE app.
